## Setting up

Prerequisites: 

- NodeJS 16
- Docker

Setting up the database on `postgres://user:password@localhost:5436/technical_test`:

```bash
# start postgresql server using Docker's "Compose"
$ docker-compose up -d 
# create and populate the database using Sequelize
$ cd database
$ cp .env.localdev .env
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run migrate
$ npm run seed:all
```

Setting up the backend on `http://localhost:7100` with Swagger on `http://localhost:7100/swagger`:

```bash
$ cd backend
$ cp .env.localdev .env
$ npm install
$ npm run start:dev
```

Setting up the frontend on `http://localhost:7200`:

```bash
$ cd frontend
$ cp .env.localdev .env
$ npm install 
$ npm run start:dev
```

Log in to the frontend as broker 1. You can find the login information in the database seeder script.

## Task - Submit loan application
Create the functionality for a broker to submit a new loan application.

  1. Show a modal after clicking the "Submit application" button, and allow the broker to enter the following information:
   
        - applicant_name
        - applicant_email
        - applicant_mobile_phone_number
        - applicant_address
        - annual_income_before_tax
        - incoming_address
        - incoming_deposit
        - incoming_price
        - incoming_stamp_duty
        - loan_amount
        - loan_duration
        - monthly_expenses
        - outgoing_address
        - outgoing_mortgage
        - outgoing_valuation
        - savings_contribution
  
  2. Add a backend endpoint to receive the application submission
  3. Query all existing applications and get the average `loan_amount`
  4. Save the new application to the `applications` table
  5. Return if new loan's loan_amount is above or below the average
